Textbelt clients (or TextBelter)
=========

***NOTE:*** this project/repo is dead, the upstream dependency service is no longer free (without use of your own API key), so it breaks the interface of these clients. But you can update them to work with the revised service, with configurable API key via settings of the extensions/addons, or to hard code your API key then build the extension/addon, or to integrate the extension/addon to work with your own private hosted instance of textbelt instead of the public service that now requires an API key.

This project site hosts various clients (browser extensions, plugins, console/terminal apps, etc.) for the free textbelt.com web-based SMS text messaging service.

Seeing as how some Google Chrome extensions have their source hosted on Google code, thought I should do similarly.
The source files here can serve as useful examples of how to port an application/gadget/widget 
across different browser/client platforms.

For more details on textbelt service, see the service website at http://www.textbelt.com.
