# textbelt-clients
A collection of end user clients to the free TextBelt SMS API service

Textbelt clients (or TextBelter)
=========

This project site hosts various clients (browser extensions, plugins, console/terminal apps, etc.) for the free textbelt.com web-based SMS text messaging service.

Seeing as how some Google Chrome extensions have their source hosted on Google code, thought I should do similarly.
The source files here can serve as useful examples of how to port an application/gadget/widget 
across different browser/client platforms.

For more details on textbelt service, see the service website at http://www.textbelt.com.
